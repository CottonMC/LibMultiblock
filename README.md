LibMultiblock is a library for making various types of multi-block constructs in the game. There are three types of multiblocks the lib will support: Big Blocks, Concrete Multiblocks, and Abstract Multiblocks.

## Big Blocks
Big blocks are constructs similar to doors or beds: collections of blocks that act in unison as one block that takes up multiple block spaces. They are placed all at once and broken all at once.

## Concrete Multiblocks (NYI)
Concrete multiblocks are constructs that take up multiple blockspaces and have an exact form, but are not placed all at once. Think Immersive Engineering machines.

## Abstract Multiblocks (NYI)
Abstract multiblocks are constructs that take up multiple blockspaces and are not placed all at once, but are more flexible on their form. Think beacons or Tinkers Construct smelteries.
